# AI-Fuse-Intrusion-Detection-with-Real-Synthetic-Data
This research project introduces "AI Fuse: Intrusion Detection with Real & Virtual Data", a 
pioneering advancement in cyber security. Our system compares real-time datasets with synthetic 
datasets to detect normal and abnormal activities using both deep learning and classical AI 
algorithms. 
The core of the system comprises sophisticated software algorithms that monitor network activities 
and identify potential security breaches. By integrating deep learning techniques with classical AI 
methods, AI Fuse effectively distinguishes between normal and suspicious activities.
Preliminary testing has demonstrated high levels of accuracy in intrusion detection. The system's 
dual-dataset approach significantly improves its ability to detect anomalies. 
This technology holds great potential for enhancing network security, providing a solid foundation 
for future innovations in this critical area. The findings and technologies developed through this 
project can substantially reduce the impact of cyber threats, thereby enhancing overall cyber 
security.
